# Holbertonschool Binary Trees

## Learning Objectives

### General
- What is a **binary tree**
- What is the difference between a _binary tree_ and a _Binary Search Tree_
- What is the possible gain in terms of _time complexity_ compared to linked lists
- What are the _depth_, the _height_, the _size_ of a binary tree
- What are the different _traversal methods_ to go through a binary tree
- What is a _complete_, a _full_, a _perfect_, a _balanced_ binary tree

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are **not** allowed to use **global variables**
- No more than _5 functions_ per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `binary_trees.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be `include guarded`
